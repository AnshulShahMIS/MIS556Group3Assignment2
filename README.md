# Career Compass with GitHub Pages

The public interface runs on GitHub Pages. AI requests go to a separate Node backend; GitHub Pages cannot execute the server or protect an API key in browser code. This repository includes both components and a deployment workflow. It does not include credentials or real student resumes.

## Deployment order

1. Create a public GitHub repository named career-compass under AnshulShahMIS and push this project to main. Do not upload a .env file. The Pages workflow intentionally fails until the backend URL is configured.
2. Deploy the Node backend from that repository to a Node web host. A Render Blueprint is included in render.yaml. It selects the free web service plan and starts node serve.mjs. Set OPENAI_API_KEY privately in the hosting service, never in public assets. The service must supply PORT and its public HTTPS URL (Render supplies RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL automatically). For another host set BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL explicitly.
3. Set the backend ALLOWED_ORIGINS value to https://anshulshahmis.github.io. This is the origin, without the repository path. It authorizes browser requests from the Pages site. CORS is not authentication: non-browser callers can still reach a public API.
4. Confirm the backend /api/status responds and test one real AI request. Copy the actual deployed backend URL; no backend URL is live merely because a configuration file exists.
5. On GitHub open Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables. Create CAREER_COMPASS_API_URL containing the public HTTPS backend URL. This value is public, not a secret. Do not put the OpenAI key here.
6. Open Settings → Pages and choose GitHub Actions as the publishing source. Run the Publish Career Compass to GitHub Pages workflow. It tests the source, builds a static-only artifact, and deploys it.
7. Use the URL returned by the successful Pages deployment. A proposed username.github.io path is not verification that publication succeeded. Test from another browser/device and verify AI MODE and a real answer.

## What is deployed to Pages

scripts/build-pages.mjs copies only dist assets to .pages and creates api-config.json containing the backend address. HTML, modules, CSS and PDF.js assets use relative paths so a repository subpath works. The workflow uploads .pages, not the repository root. Neither server code nor .env is part of that artifact. The workflow fails on an absent API URL and scans for project-key strings.

## Local testing

Requires Node.js 22 or later; no npm installation is needed for the Node app or tests.

    node --test tests/*.test.mjs
    node serve.mjs

The local copy uses a root .env or the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. Run Setup-API-Key.cmd to configure an extracted local copy. A blank dist/api-config.json uses the same local server. For a separate local backend, edit only the public apiBaseUrl field; use localhost HTTP for development or HTTPS for a public server.

## AI and privacy

One model-driven agent uses guidance retrieval plus comparison, resume review, planning and interview tools. Student messages, supplied documents, recent history, optional goals and retrieved passages are transmitted through the backend to OpenAI. The key stays server-side. store:false is requested but does not promise zero provider retention. Use redacted or fictional data for demonstration. Source IDs are validated; claim support, citation relevance and personal facts still require review.

The backend has a 90-second request timeout, six model decisions, a 1,500-token output limit per model call, two simultaneous requests, 20 attempts per minute and 60 attempts per UTC day per server process. These counters reset on process restart and are not a durable distributed quota or guaranteed dollar spending cap. Use provider billing controls as appropriate. Free hosts can sleep or impose availability limits; verify the live service before presentation. No student input is persisted by this app's backend.

## Verification and readiness

86 automated tests pass, including the existing career and adapter tests plus Pages artifact boundaries, relative assets, API configuration, CORS preflight and the shared process request limit. The existing live development checks were performed on version 0.4; this version's final public end-to-end test is pending actual deployment. Do not present the application as online until both deployments and a public AI request have been verified.

Real student usefulness testing, broader citation evaluation and the final five-minute presentation remain. The assignment permits selected career needs and does not require a multi-agent architecture.
